# "le Pouilleux" Card Game

-le Pouilleux is a card game which requires 51 cards, the standard 52-card pack minus the jack of clubs. <br />
-The computer is the card dealer.<br />
-A map is a 2 character string.<br />
-The first character represents a value and the second a color.<br />
-Values â€‹â€‹are characters like '2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','J','Q' ,'K', and 'A'.<br />
-Colors are characters like: â™ , â™¡, â™£, and â™¢.<br />
-We use 4 Unicode symbols to represent the 4 suits: spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds.<br />
-For cards of 10 we use 3 characters, because the value '10' uses two characters.<br />
